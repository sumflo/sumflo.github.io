      <p class="text"> <b>I am </b> an eight months old baby now. I am the light of mom and dad’s eyes, the cutest baby in the world. I always smile, laugh a lot, but sometimes I do a little too to keep the days from getting boring. Nothing escapes my attention and I get everything what I want (except the cables and the extension cord). I have a huge need for exercises, my parents can barely catch up me. We play a lot and have fun together. All in all, I’m a very happy baby because mom and dad love me so much.</p>

      <p class="sentence">It’s true that I’m just a baby, but I already have a lot of experience. I know a lot of things:</p>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>to get what I want, I have to use my cute-face,</li>
        <li>to chew my parents slippers, I have to be very fast,</li>
        <li>to get the remote control, I have to be very skillful,</li>
        <li>to reach mom’s books and dad’s lego, I have to stand up,</li>
        <li>to make mom and dad happy, I just have to exist.</li>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>I was able to turn over at three months.</li>
        <li>By the age of four months, I was able to get up on all fours.</li>
        <li>I started climbing at four and a half months.</li>
        <li>I sat up for the first time at five months.</li>
        <li>I stood up at six months old (of course, I clung in the meantime).</li>
        <li>I was at the hairdresser at the age of six and a half months. I have exceptionally beautiful hair. Really.</li>
        <li>And now, at the age of eight months, I hid my lower two teeth (it didn’t even hurt, it wasn’t a big deal).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="sentence">Because the force is with me.</h4>

      <h3 class="title">Freetime Activities</h3>
      <p class="sentence">Last but not least, I’ll share with you a few things that are really fun to do.</p>
      <p class="text">When Dad works from home, I always press that illuminated round button on his big black box. Then dad cries out and shakes his heads. Funny, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="text">Mom has a lot of colorful books. The best afternoon program is to take down them from the shelf and it’s good to crumpled their pages.</p>
      <p class="text">Eating. Many people love gourmet food. I also eat everything special what can I find. Be it a hair clip, a hair band, a pice of paper, socks, slippers, or the legs of the sofa. I have to taste it. Especially the cables.</p>
      <h4 class="sentence">Of course boys wanna have fun too.</h4>
